// fires when the 'add' button is clicked and passes in the click event. We first prevent the events default settings because it is within a form, and we do not want it to refresh the page. Then we copy the values of the amount and name from the input field and set them to a new variable within an object. We copy the current expenses from state and set those to a new variable that we can work with. Then we push the newExpense object onto the currentExpenses array, and then set the state  of expenses with that new updated array.

// In the meantime, we ensure that amount is an integer and set that to a new variable, and then set the current total from state to a new variable as well. We add the amount (num) to the total, and then set that new updated number to the total state.

// Finally, we set the state of amount and name back to empty strings to clear our input fields.

// With the remove item method, we pass in the items amount and it's index. We then copy expenses from state so we have a variable to work with, splice the item (using it's index) out of that array, and then set that new array to state.

// In addition, we copy the current total from state to a variable, and then subtract the amount that was passed in our method from that total. We then set that new number to the total state.
